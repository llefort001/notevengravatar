            <p>An "avatar" is an image that represents you onlineâ€”a little picture that appears next to your name when you interact with websites.</p>
            <p>A Not Even Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar. You upload it and create your profile just once, and then when you participate in any Not Even Gravatar-enabled site, your Not Even Gravatar image will automatically follow you there.</p>
            <p>Not Even Gravatar is a free service for site owners, developers, and users.</p>
            <p>Not Even Gravatar is run and supported by Lucas Lefort, Paul Laborde et Adrien De Meyer.</p>
