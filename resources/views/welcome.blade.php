            <p>An "avatar" is an image that represents you onlineâ€”a little picture that appears next to your name when you interact with websites.</p>
            <p>A Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar. You upload it and create your profile just once, and then when you participate in any NotEvenGravatar-enabled site, your Gravatar image will automatically follow you there.</p>
            <p>NotEvenGravatar is a free service for site owners, developers, and users</p>
            <p>Gravatar is run and supported by Lucas Lefort, Paul Laborde et Adrien De Meyer</p>
